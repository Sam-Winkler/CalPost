            <h2>How I Built the VFX Inclusion Letter Website</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I wanted to create a simple but effective tool to help California VFX workers advocate for including
                    visual effects in the state's film industry tax incentives. Here's how I built it:
                <p>I needed a straightforward way for VFX professionals to contact their legislators. The challenge was
                    creating something that would require minimal effort from users while still generating personalized,
                    professional-looking letters.</p>
                <p>First, I designed a simple form to collect basic information - name, email, occupation, company and
                    address. The address part was crucial because I needed to determine which specific California
                    legislators represented each user.</p>
                <p>For the technical implementation, I kept things lightweight and focused. I used plain HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript without any heavy frameworks. This keeps the site fast and means it can be hosted almost
                    anywhere with minimal resources.</p>
                <p>The most interesting part was integrating with Google's Civic Information API. This service lets you
                    look up elected officials based on a physical address. I set up a function that takes the user's
                    address, queries the API, and returns both their State Senator and Assembly Member.</p>
                <p>I ran into a few challenges along the way. One tricky part was handling the email addresses for
                    legislators. At first, I tried maintaining a full database of California legislators with their
                    contact info, but this approach had issues. I eventually simplified it to follow the standard email
                    patterns used by the California legislature (senator.lastname@senate.ca.gov and
                    assemblymember.lastname@assembly.ca.gov).</p>
                <p>For the letter content, I crafted a template that makes a clear, concise case for including VFX in
                    film incentives. The system automatically fills in the right legislator names and adds the user's
                    personal information. It generates two separate letters - one for the State Senator and one for the
                    Assembly Member.</p>
                <p>I added some quality-of-life features like "copy to clipboard" buttons and tabbed navigation between
                    the two letters. I also included clear instructions and a note about data privacy to reassure users
                    that their information stays in their browser.</p>
                <p>The site doesn't need a backend server since all the processing happens client-side in JavaScript.
                    This makes it perfect for hosting on GitHub Pages, which is not only free but also secure and
                    reliable.</p>
                <p>I am pretty busy these days and I really only had one day to put this site together, so I used
                    Claude.ai to help me with all the code and implementation.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I'm happy with how the project turned out. It's a simple, focused tool that serves a
                    specific purpose and hopefully will help amplify the voices of VFX workers in California who are
                    advocating for fair treatment in the state's film incentive programs.</p>
